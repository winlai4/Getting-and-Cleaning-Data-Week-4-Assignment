# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment

This repository is my submission for Getting and Cleaning Data week 4 assignment. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on the dataset.

Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

CodeBook.md 
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

r_analysis.R 
R script to perform the data preparation and then:
1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) calculates mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyData.txt 
is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
